    '# What is Digital Marketing and Why Do You Need It?\n\nWhen it comes to marketing your business, it’s no secret that the Internet is a crucial component to making sure you’re connecting with as many customers as possible. More than 75 percent of Americans are online at some point during the day, with 43 percent logging on multiple times daily. In fact, more than a quarter of Internet users are online consistently. Billboards, print ads, and television commercials all have their place, but the web is king when it comes to its potential reach.\n\n \n\nWith so many businesses online, the question becomes how to create an effective digital marketing strategy that will connect with current and potential future customers? There can be a lot to wade through, but don’t let it overwhelm you.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image2.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## What is Digital Marketing?\n\nThis is a broad term that applies to marketing viewed on computers and mobile devices. That includes social media platforms, websites, targeted ads, blogs, promotional videos hosted on sites like YouTube, and more. Essentially, if it requires the Internet, it can be considered a component of digital marketing.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image3.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## Do I Really Need to Market My Business Online?\n\nDepending on the kind of business you’re running and who your target audience is, your footprint online may be substantial, or it could be quite minimal. Each product or service is advertised differently, and traditional marketing methods are better suited to some. If your potential customer base consists of people that aren’t using the Internet – 25 percent of adults over the age of 65 in the United States fall into this category – then you’re going to have more success using print ads, billboards, or television commercials.\n\n \n\nOverall, just seven percent of American adults say they don’t use the Internet, so unless you’re a niche business looking to attract only people in that group, you should strongly consider building an online presence. Word-of-mouth is also incredibly effective, meaning that even someone you’re not looking to sell to could come across your website or social media account and refer a potential customer to you.\n\n \n\nThere’s no need to create a massive and intricate site; even something basic that includes your company name and contact information is easy to create and can be very rewarding.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image4.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## How Do I Build a Digital Marketing Campaign?\n\nBoth independent marketing experts and advertising agencies can help with this facet of your business, and if you have the budget, it’s advisable to work with someone who understands that field and can help you to create a plan that will attract customers. That said, it has become easier over the past several years to do a lot of this work on your own, at least when you’re getting started.\n\n \n\nIt’s a good idea to have a website with your business name attached to the domain. The last thing you want is for someone with a similar name to be siphoning off customers simply because they were able to get the web address first. Before you take any major steps, Google available domain names to see what your options are and be sure to keep your site address as simple as possible. You want something that people won’t forget, and luckily, many domain names are very cheap to buy and only require a small annual payment.\n\n \n\nOnce you’ve got your domain, create social media accounts under the same name (again, this may take some searching to find what’s available and makes sense.) Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are all good places to build an online presence and engage with your customers.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image5.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## What Do I Do If I Don’t Know How to Build a Website?\n\nYou can hire a web developer to create a site for you, and many of them will also have expertise in SEO (more on what that means in a moment). This is a person that can create and maintain a custom online home for your business, giving it the look and feel that you want. You can be hands-off and never worry about the details of how to build or rearrange your site.\n\n \n\nHowever, many good and reasonably priced options exist to help you create your own site, and they do most of the heavy lifting for you. Companies like Wix and Squarespace offer monthly hosting plans and designer templates that allow you to incorporate text, photos, graphics, and even an online store and dedicated email accounts, and they have customer service representatives ready and willing to answer any questions you may have.\n\n \n\nThe benefit of running your own site is that you can quickly and easily make changes, add or remove products, advertise current and future promotions, all with a few clicks of the mouse. There’s no need to make a call and see when your developer is available, because you’re in control.\n\n \n\nWhether you plan to work with a professional or you’re looking to take on this task personally, both options have their benefits.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image6.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## What Exactly is SEO?\n\nThis is one of the biggest mysteries when it comes to marketing tactics, yet it’s also one of the most important pieces to utilize. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, refers to the processes and techniques used to get your business in front of as many eyes as possible.\n\n \n\nHere’s an example: if you’re in Los Angeles and you search for an electrician, you’ll get more than 16 million results. The vast majority of people won’t even scroll all the way to the bottom of the first page before clicking on an option. The higher the ranking, the more effective those sites are with their SEO strategies. This means their content includes key words related to electrical services, they load quickly and they feature quality, engaging content.\n\n \n\nThere are services that specialize in creating SEO for your website, but do your research on these companies if you’re planning to use one. A great place to start? Search for SEO services online and see who comes up first.\n\n \n\nThis isn’t to say that SEO is the only way to get traffic – it’s an organic method of growing your visibility and is free to implement (unless you hire a company to help you.) Paid marketing is another effective option and, combined with SEO, can produce even better results.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image7.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## How Does Paid Digital Marketing Work?\n\nIf you’re looking to invest in an ad spend, the internet is a valuable place to do it. From news websites to search engines to pages dedicated to specific services, advertising is all over the web. You can get in on this too, either by working with a marketing agency or by contacting the advertising departments of different websites to inquire about their rates and requirements.\n\n \n\nYou can promote posts and make ad buys on social media as well. A social media marketer can be hired to help you with this, or you can do it on your own with business accounts for Facebook and Instagram. A small amount of money can get your business in front of a large number of people very quickly, and it’s easy to target the right audience for your product so you’re not wasting your money on people that won’t be interested in your services. This also helps to build out your brand awareness, giving you added visibility.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image8.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## Should I Create an Email Campaign?\n\nThere are companies that will create custom email campaigns on your behalf, sending messages about promotions, new products or upcoming sales to your customers. This is especially effective with existing customers who sign up for your email list, and to incentivize their engagement with you, it helps to offer exclusives or products to your subscribers before they’re available to the general public.\n\n \n\nYou can also take this on yourself, managing and sending out your own promotional emails. Just make sure you’re not abusing the privilege of having someone’s email address – no one likes spam, so it’s best to not overdo it. Send emails when you genuinely have something new or interesting to offer, make sure they’re engaging and not too long, and test them on a computer as well as a smartphone to ensure they read well no matter how they’re received.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image9.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## Are There Other Do’s and Don’ts of Digital Marketing to be Aware of?\n\nThe customer journey is always evolving, and therefore online marketing is evolving with it. It’s important to keep an open mind and to not get discouraged if a particular strategy doesn’t pan out. Sometimes it just needs a minor tweak; on other occasions you may need to scrap it and start over.\n\n \n\nWhat’s important to remember is that small businesses can thrive by using different digital marketing channels. Dip your toes in the waters of websites, social media, email campaigns and a little paid advertising. Don’t make an overly ambitious financial commitment right away – focus on a realistic, targeted approach to your content marketing, and who knows? It may bring in so much business you need to hire more people to meet demand, and when you do, that’s when you can increase your digital marketing footprint.',
