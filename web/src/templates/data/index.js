If yes, with which tool?\n* What do I want to know about graphic design?\n* What are the basics of graphic design?\n* Which aspect do I want to focus on? Image editing? Vector-based graphics?\n* What do I need for graphic design training?\n* What is the best software to start with?\n\n\n### What to Consider When Choosing a Graphic Design Tool\n\nWhen choosing the best graphic design tool, you must consider a few things to ensure you make the best decision.

For example, if you’re interested in only Image editing and manipulation, Adobe Photoshop is a great option to consider. \n\n\n    But if you’re more interested in vector graphics design, CorelDRAW or Adobe Illustrator are more suitable options.\n\n\n#### \n    Budget\n\n\n    _How much can you afford to spend?_\n\n\n    If you have a low budget or no budget at all, then you’ll want to stick to free or less expensive tools like Canva and Gravit Designer.\n\n\n#### \n    Features\n\n\n    _Do you prefer extensive/specific editing tools or functionality?_\n\n\n    If yes, choose a design software that offers those functionalities. Not all software will provide the functionalities you want, so, ensure you check.\n\n\n## Learn How To Use Graphic Design Tools\n\nYou need an arsenal of top graphics design tools to kickstart your career as a graphic designer.

      'When it comes to marketing your business, it’s no secret that the Internet is a crucial component to making sure you’re connecting with as many customers as possible. More than 75 percent of Americans are online at some point during the day, with 43 percent logging on multiple times daily. In fact, more than a quarter of Internet users are online consistently. Billboards, print ads, and television commercials all have their place, but the web is king when it comes to its potential reach.\n\n \n\nWith so many businesses online, the question becomes how to create an effective digital marketing strategy that will connect with current and potential future customers? There can be a lot to wade through, but don’t let it overwhelm you.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image2.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## What is Digital Marketing?\n\nThis is a broad term that applies to marketing viewed on computers and mobile devices. That includes social media platforms, websites, targeted ads, blogs, promotional videos hosted on sites like YouTube, and more. Essentially, if it requires the Internet, it can be considered a component of digital marketing.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image3.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## Do I Really Need to Market My Business Online?\n\nDepending on the kind of business you’re running and who your target audience is, your footprint online may be substantial, or it could be quite minimal. Each product or service is advertised differently, and traditional marketing methods are better suited to some. If your potential customer base consists of people that aren’t using the Internet – 25 percent of adults over the age of 65 in the United States fall into this category – then you’re going to have more success using print ads, billboards, or television commercials.\n\n \n\nOverall, just seven percent of American adults say they don’t use the Internet, so unless you’re a niche business looking to attract only people in that group, you should strongly consider building an online presence. Word-of-mouth is also incredibly effective, meaning that even someone you’re not looking to sell to could come across your website or social media account and refer a potential customer to you.\n\n \n\nThere’s no need to create a massive and intricate site; even something basic that includes your company name and contact information is easy to create and can be very rewarding.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image4.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## How Do I Build a Digital Marketing Campaign?\n\nBoth independent marketing experts and advertising agencies can help with this facet of your business, and if you have the budget, it’s advisable to work with someone who understands that field and can help you to create a plan that will attract customers. That said, it has become easier over the past several years to do a lot of this work on your own, at least when you’re getting started.\n\n \n\nIt’s a good idea to have a website with your business name attached to the domain. The last thing you want is for someone with a similar name to be siphoning off customers simply because they were able to get the web address first. Before you take any major steps, Google available domain names to see what your options are and be sure to keep your site address as simple as possible. You want something that people won’t forget, and luckily, many domain names are very cheap to buy and only require a small annual payment.\n\n \n\nOnce you’ve got your domain, create social media accounts under the same name (again, this may take some searching to find what’s available and makes sense.) Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are all good places to build an online presence and engage with your customers.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image5.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## What Do I Do If I Don’t Know How to Build a Website?\n\nYou can hire a web developer to create a site for you, and many of them will also have expertise in SEO (more on what that means in a moment). This is a person that can create and maintain a custom online home for your business, giving it the look and feel that you want. You can be hands-off and never worry about the details of how to build or rearrange your site.\n\n \n\nHowever, many good and reasonably priced options exist to help you create your own site, and they do most of the heavy lifting for you. Companies like Wix and Squarespace offer monthly hosting plans and designer templates that allow you to incorporate text, photos, graphics, and even an online store and dedicated email accounts, and they have customer service representatives ready and willing to answer any questions you may have.\n\n \n\nThe benefit of running your own site is that you can quickly and easily make changes, add or remove products, advertise current and future promotions, all with a few clicks of the mouse. There’s no need to make a call and see when your developer is available, because you’re in control.\n\n \n\nWhether you plan to work with a professional or you’re looking to take on this task personally, both options have their benefits.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image6.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## What Exactly is SEO?\n\nThis is one of the biggest mysteries when it comes to marketing tactics, yet it’s also one of the most important pieces to utilize. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, refers to the processes and techniques used to get your business in front of as many eyes as possible.\n\n \n\nHere’s an example: if you’re in Los Angeles and you search for an electrician, you’ll get more than 16 million results. The vast majority of people won’t even scroll all the way to the bottom of the first page before clicking on an option. The higher the ranking, the more effective those sites are with their SEO strategies. This means their content includes key words related to electrical services, they load quickly and they feature quality, engaging content.\n\n \n\nThere are services that specialize in creating SEO for your website, but do your research on these companies if you’re planning to use one. A great place to start? Search for SEO services online and see who comes up first.\n\n \n\nThis isn’t to say that SEO is the only way to get traffic – it’s an organic method of growing your visibility and is free to implement (unless you hire a company to help you.) Paid marketing is another effective option and, combined with SEO, can produce even better results.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image7.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## How Does Paid Digital Marketing Work?\n\nIf you’re looking to invest in an ad spend, the internet is a valuable place to do it. From news websites to search engines to pages dedicated to specific services, advertising is all over the web. You can get in on this too, either by working with a marketing agency or by contacting the advertising departments of different websites to inquire about their rates and requirements.\n\n \n\nYou can promote posts and make ad buys on social media as well. A social media marketer can be hired to help you with this, or you can do it on your own with business accounts for Facebook and Instagram. A small amount of money can get your business in front of a large number of people very quickly, and it’s easy to target the right audience for your product so you’re not wasting your money on people that won’t be interested in your services. This also helps to build out your brand awareness, giving you added visibility.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image8.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## Should I Create an Email Campaign?\n\nThere are companies that will create custom email campaigns on your behalf, sending messages about promotions, new products or upcoming sales to your customers. This is especially effective with existing customers who sign up for your email list, and to incentivize their engagement with you, it helps to offer exclusives or products to your subscribers before they’re available to the general public.\n\n \n\nYou can also take this on yourself, managing and sending out your own promotional emails. Just make sure you’re not abusing the privilege of having someone’s email address – no one likes spam, so it’s best to not overdo it. Send emails when you genuinely have something new or interesting to offer, make sure they’re engaging and not too long, and test them on a computer as well as a smartphone to ensure they read well no matter how they’re received.\n\n \n\n\n### \n![alt_text](images/image9.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\n\n## Are There Other Do’s and Don’ts of Digital Marketing to be Aware of?\n\nThe customer journey is always evolving, and therefore online marketing is evolving with it. It’s important to keep an open mind and to not get discouraged if a particular strategy doesn’t pan out. Sometimes it just needs a minor tweak; on other occasions you may need to scrap it and start over.\n\n \n\nWhat’s important to remember is that small businesses can thrive by using different digital marketing channels. Dip your toes in the waters of websites, social media, email campaigns and a little paid advertising. Don’t make an overly ambitious financial commitment right away – focus on a realistic, targeted approach to your content marketing, and who knows? It may bring in so much business you need to hire more people to meet demand, and when you do, that’s when you can increase your digital marketing footprint.',

If you struggle to find the right art to license for your business, then peruse this write-up to get the detailed information regarding art licensing. \n\nTo assist with your quest to find the right art, we have covered a wide array of topics, such as understanding the concept of licensing, the process of licensing, its importance, and its legal and financial aspects. \n\n\n> *“An artist is not paid for his labor but for his vision.” – James Whistler*\n\nEach segment covers relevant information pertaining to art licensing. You can expect to get answers to queries about the meaning, process, agreement, and monetary facet of art licensing.\n\nLet us dive into this guide with the erudite information about art licensing.\n\n\n## How to Find the Right Art to License for Your Business?\n\nFinding the right art to license for a new business might not be as simple as it looks. However, you can start your new venture confidently and succeed with proper knowledge and reliable information.\n\nThe majority of the companies that buy artwork for commercial use have a greater inclination towards something that can be used across a product range. It infers that the artwork should comprise variations on a theme. Basically, this type of art is what defines the licensee requirement. \n\nWhile some would naturally fit, other artists are required to put in the effort to create such artwork with a commercial approach. But before we dig deeper, let us get some clarification on the concept of licensing artwork. \n\n\n## Understanding the Concept of Licensing Artwork\n\nSo, what is art licensing? When artists rent out their artwork (while retaining the copyrights) to other companies for reproduction in a mutually agreed way, it is termed as [licensing artwork](https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/strategy/how-to-license-your-artwork). A legal contract is created to authenticate the terms of the licensing agreement. Therefore, it is basically permission to use the artwork contract.\n\n\n## What Kind of Art Is Good for Licensing?\n\nAny art created by graphics artists or visual artists is good for licensing, and it includes digital art licensing and fine art licensing. \n\nLicensed artwork is mostly used in products such as greeting cards, cups, pillows, blankets, homeware, toys for kids, stationery items, gifts, wallpapers, etc. \n\n\n> *“Art evokes the mystery without which the world would not exist.” – Rene Magritte*\n\nWhile creating the artwork, the prime focus should be on creating work as a set or series. The major advantage of doing so is that your artwork can now be easily translated into a full product range. Selling them as one-off products would be difficult. \n\nConsider artwork on wallpapers, fabric printing, or stationery. The pattern of the artwork is repetitive in such domains. Such artwork would be the right art for licensing. \n\nYou may use any medium for licensed artwork; however, it is important that you use high-resolution scanned images for licensee use.\n\nAnother important notion is the fact that companies prefer using the latest and trendy artwork. Therefore, you need to ensure that your art is up to date with modern trends and style. Approaching them with something that matches their expectation is what this business is all about. \n\n\n## Is Licensing art worthwhile?\n\nNow, this is a tricky one, and the answer honestly depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a steady monthly prime source of income, then probably licensing is not a good place to start. First, the royalty or commission payments from licensing are generally paid quarterly. Second, it takes time to build that level of client-base. \n\n\n> *“One of the nice things about licensing music to movies or advertisements is you can reach a lot of people who normally wouldn\'t hear music.” - Moby*\n\nThat being said, the earning potential in the licensing business is tremendous. The royalty income can go as high as millions of dollars annually. However, it would be wise to get into licensing business if you already have a major source of income and are willing to put in the time and effort to grow this source of income gradually. \n\n\n## How to Get Art Licensed?\n\n\n![alt_text](images/image2.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\nGetting an art license comes under a legal framework, and it is done by creating an art licensing agreement. \n\nIf you are wondering, “What is an art licensing agreement?”, then let us explain. It is a legally structured document with various details about the art, its use, time frame, and all the other agreed terms and conditions related to the contract. The artwork is licensed once the licensor and the licensee sign this agreement.\n\nThe licensee and licensor can get into the agreement on their own or use art licensing companies\' services. These companies know how to license artwork and can make the process easier.\n\nGetting an art license is a comprehensive process, and, naturally, you might have numerous questions and thoughts about it. If you would like to know more, then check out [this article.](https://startupresource.center/review/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-art-licensing) It covers various aspects of artwork licensing agreement, like how to understand art licensing contracts, and also offers tips to get an artwork license agreement template.\n\n\n## The Financial Aspect\n\n\n![alt_text](images/image3.jpg "image_tooltip")\n\n\nWe have yet to discuss the monetary aspect of art licensing. You must still be curious to get answers to questions such as:\n\n\n\n* What is a typical licensing fee?\n* How much does art licensing cost?\n* How are royalties paid to artists?\n\nTypically, the licensing fee for artwork can be either fixed or percentage base. The licensing fee or the royalty varies from product to product. You may want to check the industry average for your product to negotiate a realistic fee figure. \n\nGetting a licensing contract done from a lawyer may cost somewhere between the range of $100-$500 depending on the hours they put in. However, many online resources offer art licensing agreement templates at a fixed cost ranging from $50 to $100. But if you are looking for something drafted [as per your needs](https://startupresource.center/review/small-business-startup-law-firm-invest-in-counsel-that-fits-your-needs), the cost may go as high as $1200. \n\n\n## Royalty and Commissions\n\nThere are certainly major differences between royalty and commissions. [Royalties](https://researchpedia.info/difference-between-royalties-and-commissions/) are offered on intellectual property such as art. The company pays a specific percentage of sale or profit to the copyright holder on an ongoing basis against the right to use their intellectual property for commercial use. Whereas commission is paid as a one-time payment against a sale or profit. \n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nFinding the right art to license for your business may become a daunting task if you start without the correct information. Hopefully, this write-up helped you gain valuable insight into art licensing.
