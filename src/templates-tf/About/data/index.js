    "Angel Scale, LLC, and Startup Resource Center (SRC) were created to support those who are relatively new to starting, owning, and running a successful business. Founded in March of 2021, Angel Scale began by helping five new businesses hit the ground running: Grey and Bash Teas -- a loose-leaf tea company, Honey Sweet Collective -- a company that manufactures and sells fun coffee mugs, Insomnia PJ -- a high-end line of women's loungewear, Hot Fit NYC -- a Mixed Martial Arts fitness facility in NYC, and Medical Doorway -- an International Education firm that helps high school graduates enroll in Medical schools in six countries throughout Europe and Asia.  Each of these companies is now thriving, thanks to the resources, insight, and support offered by Angel Scale’s business experts.",

SRC further recognizes that great ideas are only a starting point, and thus aims to connect entrepreneurs with people and companies that can provide the tools, software, and expertise needed to pave the way to success.',

We fully believe in the path from living room to CEO suite, and that, with proper guidance, any strong idea can become a successful business entity.',

    bioOne: `Michael Platt is a serial entrepreneur, and earned the distinction of Ernst and Young's "Entrepreneur of the Year". Having built and sold successful businesses in the 80's and early 90's including a fundraising restaurant discount card, a professional wrestling organization, a fine photography online art store, a chain of schools that trained people to become personal fitness trainers and massage therapists, and an advertising agency, Platt embarked on what was to be his final entrepreneurial venture, an education marketing firm called PlattForm Advertising (now Keypath Education).  `,
    bioTwo: `From a humble beginning in the basement of his home, Platt built the marketing firm to  over 250 million in revenue with over 400 employees and offices in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia, before taking it public on the ASX, the Australian stock market.  Ultimately, this final venture was far from final as Platt found himself joining boards of directors and consulting friends and family, and decided retirement was not for him.  He pulled together a team of people he knew, trusted and whose opinions and successes he valued, and formed Angel Scale, LLC.`,
